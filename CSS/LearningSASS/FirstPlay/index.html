      <h2>The problem...</h2>
      <p class="p1">
        CSS has always confused and scared me - not because of the options and
        settings to remember, but the layout and how different that is to other
        languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently I found that CSS is difficult for everyone to learn, and that a
        pre-processing language (Sass) exists to make writing and maintaining
        CSS easier!

    <div class="section second">
      <h2>The solution...</h2>
      <p>
        I have enrolled in a short course for CSS to improve on my base skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will also be learning Sass in parallel with this, and using it to
        replicate what I have learnt in CSS.
